# 📚 CS50 Cybersecurity - Lecture 0: Securing Accounts

Welcome to **CS50's Introduction to Cybersecurity**! In this lecture, we’ll dive into the world of **securing accounts**, exploring the threats we face and the defenses we can employ to protect our digital identities. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to deepen your understanding, this guide will provide you with a comprehensive overview of account security.

## 🛡️ **Introduction to Account Security**

In today’s digital age, we all have numerous accounts—be it for websites, apps, or other online services. The goal of this lecture is to understand the **threats** to these accounts and the **defenses** we can implement to keep them secure.

### 🔑 **Physical Security vs. Digital Security**
- **Physical Security**: In the physical world, we use keys to access buildings. If someone else gets hold of that key, they can access the same space.
- **Digital Security**: In the digital world, we use **usernames** and **passwords** to authenticate ourselves. However, if someone gains access to your credentials, they can compromise your account.

## 🔐 **Authentication and Authorization**

### 🔍 **Authentication**
- **Definition**: The process of proving your identity in the digital world (e.g., logging in with a username and password).
- **Example**: When you log in to an account, you’re authenticating yourself as the rightful user.

### 🚪 **Authorization**
- **Definition**: Determines what level of access you have once you’ve authenticated yourself.
- **Example**: Even if you’re authenticated, you may only have access to certain parts of a system or website.

## 🧠 **The Role of Passwords**

### 📝 **Usernames and Passwords**
- **Usernames**: Often public (e.g., your email address).
- **Passwords**: Should be private and unique to each account.

### 🛡️ **The Importance of Strong Passwords**
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Hackers use lists of common words to guess passwords.
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Hackers try every possible combination of characters to crack your password.

### 🧮 **Password Complexity**
- **Four-Digit Passcodes**: Only 10,000 possible combinations, making them easy to crack.
- **Four-Letter Passwords**: Using uppercase and lowercase letters increases the complexity to 52^4 (7 million possibilities).
- **Four-Character Passwords**: Including letters, numbers, and punctuation increases the complexity to 94^4 (78 million possibilities).
- **Eight-Character Passwords**: With 94^8 possibilities, the complexity skyrockets to 6 quadrillion combinations, making it much harder to crack.

## 🛠️ **Defending Against Attacks**

### 🔒 **Best Practices for Passwords**
1. **Length**: Use at least 8 characters.
2. **Complexity**: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3. **Uniqueness**: Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts.

### 🚫 **Common Password Mistakes**
- **Dictionary Words**: Avoid using common words found in dictionaries.
- **Repetitive Characters**: Avoid sequences like "aaaaaa" or "12345".
- **Context-Specific Words**: Avoid using the name of the service or your username in your password.

### 🔄 **Password Changes**
- **Avoid Frequent Changes**: Forcing users to change passwords too often can lead to weaker passwords (e.g., "password1", "password2").
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement mechanisms to limit the number of failed login attempts, slowing down brute force attacks.

## 🔑 **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

### 🔐 **What is 2FA?**
- **Definition**: A security process that requires two different types of authentication factors.
- **Factors**:
  1. **Knowledge**: Something you know (e.g., a password).
  2. **Possession**: Something you have (e.g., a phone or key fob).
  3. **Inherence**: Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or facial recognition).

### 📱 **One-Time Passwords (OTP)**
- **Definition**: A temporary code sent to your phone or generated by an app.
- **Security**: More secure than SMS-based OTPs, as SMS can be intercepted via SIM swapping.

---

## 🕵️ **Other Threats and Defenses**

### 🎣 **Phishing**
- **Definition**: Tricking users into revealing sensitive information by pretending to be a legitimate entity.
- **Defense**: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

### 🧑‍💻 **Social Engineering**
- **Definition**: Manipulating people into divulging confidential information.
- **Example**: Asking someone to write down their password on a piece of paper.

### 🖥️ **Keylogging**
- **Definition**: Malware that records every keystroke, potentially capturing passwords.
- **Defense**: Avoid using untrusted devices and keep your software up to date.

---

## 🛡️ **Password Managers**

### 🔐 **What is a Password Manager?**
- **Definition**: Software that securely stores and manages your passwords.
- **Benefits**:
  - Generates strong, unique passwords for each account.
  - Automatically fills in login credentials.
  - Protects against phishing by only filling in credentials on legitimate sites.

### 🗝️ **Master Password**
- **Importance**: The password manager itself is protected by a single, strong master password.
- **Best Practice**: Make this password long, complex, and memorable.

---

## 🔮 **The Future: Passkeys**

### 🔑 **What are Passkeys?**
- **Definition**: A new authentication method that uses cryptographic keys instead of passwords.
- **Benefits**:
  - No need to remember passwords.
  - Synchronized across devices.
  - More secure than traditional passwords.

---

## 📖 **Conclusion**

Securing your accounts is a **balancing act** between **usability** and **security**. By following best practices—such as using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and leveraging password managers—you can significantly reduce the risk of your accounts being compromised.
